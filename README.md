# What it does
This is a simple to-do list using react and localhost. You're able to see if an item is checked off by the green mark on the left, you can also delete the tasks or change the checked off mark. It is somewhat old, but the only small project I wanted to add.

# Running the Code
Then install the packages and run the code locally with 'npm run dev'
